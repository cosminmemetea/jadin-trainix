Run your app:

Open src/main/java/…/Application.java (the class with @SpringBootApplication)

Click the green ▶ in the gutter or right-click → Run 'Application.main()'

In the console you should see “Started Application in … seconds” and then Vaadin’s debug banner

Browse to http://localhost:8080, and you’ll see the default (empty) Vaadin view.
